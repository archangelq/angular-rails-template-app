        <p>Want to get working with Rails, AngularJS, and Bootstrap quick and easy? Don't want to have to worry
 about getting your angular app working with the asset pipeline? Here's the place to get started.</p>

<p>If you haven't already, create your new app like so:</p>

<pre><code>rails new myapp -T -m https://raw.github.com/archangelq/elvis_sandwich/master/angular_rails_application_template.rb
</code></pre>

<p>Fire up your new app with <code>rails server</code>, go to localhost:3000, and you should be presented with
 this readme, as well as some simple output from your running AngularJS app, listing the cool stuff
 you have installed and working!</p>

<p>This template also includes the very useful
 <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router"><code>ui-router</code></a> and
 <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/"><code>ui-bootstrap</code></a> angular module, as well as the
 <a href="https://github.com/dmathieu/angular-rails-templates"><code>angular-rails-template</code></a>  and
 <a href="https://github.com/FineLinePrototyping/angularjs-rails-resource"><code>angularjs-rails-resource</code></a> gems.</p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>

<h2>
<a name="whats-included" class="anchor" href="#whats-included"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's included</h2>

<p>All of the Angular code lives in the <code>app/assets/javascripts/ng-app</code> folder.
 If you are reading this file from your newly created app, you are reading the output
 of <code>templates/coolThings.html.erb</code> file. Start making modifications to it, reload your browser,
 and you should see them show up!</p>

<p>Also included are <code>controllers/cool-things.js</code> and <code>services/cool-things.js</code>. 
 These load the list of cool things from the Rails server, from the
 ApplicationController#cool_things method, at route /cool-things, demonstrating
 bare bones usage of the <code>angularjs-rails-resource</code> gem.</p>

<h2>
<a name="testing" class="anchor" href="#testing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing</h2>

<p><a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> and <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a>
 are included for Rails testing. No default tests are set up. In future
 the ApplicationController#cool_things method may be unit and integration tested.</p>

<p><a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/index.html">Karma</a> and
 <a href="http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> are included for Angular testing.
 Because of the complexity of
 setting this up correctly, two basic spec files are included in the <code>spec/javascripts</code> directory.
 These unit test the controller and service above. You can run them with <code>rake test:karma</code> to
 start the karma server and file watcher running, or <code>rake test:karma:once</code> to see the results
 of a single test run. My thanks to the author of
 <a href="https://github.com/monterail/rails-angular-karma-example"><code>rails-angular-karma-example</code></a>
 for a great starting place to create the rake task that I've included along with this to make
 firing up and tearing down the Karma server easy.</p>

<h2>
<a name="a-note-on-referencing-templates" class="anchor" href="#a-note-on-referencing-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A note on referencing templates</h2>

<p>In order to load the templates that the <code>angular-rails-template</code> gem inlines for you 
 from the ui-router, you'll
 need have the url be <code>ng-app/templates/&lt;template_filename&gt;</code>, rather than simply
 <code>&lt;template_filename&gt;</code>, due to the way that Rails' Asset Pipeline works. Note that this
 allows you to add .erb on to the end of files, and have it be processed by ERB before
 being streamlined into the templateCache, as well as any of the other things you can do with
 the Rails asset pipeline, including using Coffeescript, Haml, etc.</p>

<h3>
<a name="caveats" class="anchor" href="#caveats"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Caveats</h3>

<p>This template assumes you are starting a new app. It removes certain conflicting files,
 such as the ApplicationController and application layout files.</p>
